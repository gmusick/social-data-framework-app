<p class="body-copy">A step toward creating an impartial, <a href="#">comprehensive</a> and searchable national database of people killed during interactions with law enforcement.</p>
<p class="body-copy">“The nation’s leading law enforcement agency [FBI] collects vast amounts of information on crime nationwide, but missing from this clearinghouse are statistics on where, how often, and under what circumstances police use deadly force. In fact, no one anywhere comprehensively tracks the most significant act police can do in the line of duty: take a life,” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal in its series Deadly Force (Nov. 28, 2011).</p>
<p class="body-copy">This site is founded upon the premise that Americans should have the ability to track that act. This idea was conceived in the wake of the Oct. 6, 2012, killing of a naked, unarmed college student, Gil Collar, at the University of South Alabama. Media reports contained no context: How many people are killed by police in Alabama every year? How many in the United States?</p>
<p class="body-copy">It turned out that Collar was on drugs, including marijuana and the hallucinogen 25-I. It also turned out the freshman never got within 5 feet of the officer, and the officer attempted no less-lethal methods to subdue Collar. On March 1, 2013, the policeman was cleared of wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="caption">Fatal Encounters is intended to help create a database of all deaths through police interaction in the United States since Jan. 1, 2000. You can check to see how far we’ve gotten with your state here. We have three main methods of collecting information. They are, in order of numbers of records in the database: 1) Paid researchers; 2) Public records requests; 3) Crowdsourced data.</p>
